TODO:
	- Proper inside Scripting
		- System plugin
		- Statistics plugin (graphs,charts)
	- Change the way the edit-field behaves. Add save/apply-button
Done:
	+ Change NSArrayController not to prepare content since that's already done in awakeFromNib in PlayController
	+ Check on how to create _small_ NSWindow (when rendering with background the window is as large as it should be, beware of margins)
		+ Check on using NSPanel instead (sucked, didn't make any difference)
	+ Update windows when content change
	+ WindowMoving
